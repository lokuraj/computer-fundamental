4.Touch Screen:
------------------

- Touch Screen is a computer display which is used as aninput device
- These screens are very sensitive to the pressure user can interact  with  your computer by touch on some picture, Buttons etc...
- There are three typesof Screens
	1. Resistive 
	2. SurfaceWave
	3. Capacitive

What is Resistive Touch?
	- Pressure as an input is called resistive touch
	- It is made upof several layers of flexible plastic and glass
	- The front layer is scratch resistance
	- Second layer is generally Glass
	- These both are coated with conductive material, when someone applies pressure to the panel resistsance is measured betwwen the two layer

What is SurfaceAcoustic Wave Touch (SAW)?
	- it uses ultrasonic waves to detect the touch input
	- on tapping or touching the display  interface,the ultrasonic waves in that area are disturbed , allowing  the touch screen's interface to detect the positionof touch command

	BENIFITS:
	1. they are limited to using a bare finger for input
	2. they don't required conductive object to register a touch
	3. Unlike Capacitive Touch Sceen SAW touch screen can be operated with object that can absorb ulrasonic waves which includes things like Heavily gloved hands.
	
	DISADVANTAGES:
	1. SAW Screens are not recommended for outer environment
	2. as they can be affected by large amount of dirt, dust, water droplets etc...
	3. otherwise they provide simple , attractive interfacefor indoor applications
	eg:  Metro railway station or Automatic Ticket Machine uses this technology for Ticket Booking

What is Capacitive Touch?
	- it uses electrical properties of human body as input
	- when touched with a finger a small electrical charge is drawn to the point o contact.
	- it will allow the display to detect where it has received as input
	- The result is a display that can detect  lighter touches and greater accuracy than Resistive Touch
	Eg: Mobile Touch Screen

Which one is Batter?

- capacitive touch technology is more rapid and has great revolution in recent years
- capacitive touch screens are improving in both performance and cost

		(ATX- Advance Technology EXtended)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. PROCESSOR:
----------------

- it called CPU
- logical circuit respond to the basic instruction which executes your computer
- you can see CPU as IC (Integrated Circuit) chip  in a computer, which responsible for interpreting most of your  computer commands
- elements of CPU are

	1. ALU(Arithmatic and Logical Unit)	
		- ALU is a main component of Central Processing Unit(CPU).
		- its main function is to perform arithmatic and logical operation
		- it is also known as Integer Unit(IU) which is IC within CPUwhich is last component to perform calculations in the processor
		- it obeys Logic Gates and its value like XOR,OR,NOT,AND,NAND and EXOR operation in Logic gates 
	2. CU(Control Unit)
		- it controls the operation of all parts of the computer but doesn't carry any actual data processing operation 
		- it is responsible for controlling data transfer
		- it manages all the uniots of computer
		- it communicate with input / output device for transfer of data or result from storage
		- it don't store or process data
	3. CACHE Memory:
		- Cache memory is high speed memory, which is small in size but faster than main menory(RAM).
		- The CPU can access it more quickly than primary memory
		- Cache memory can only be accessed by CPU.
		- it can be reseve part of main memory or storage device outside the CPU.
		- it holds the data of program which are currently / frequently used by the CPU.
		- it makes sure that the data is instantly available for CPU,whenever CPU needs this data
		- it doesn't require RAM.
		- There are three types of Cache Memory
			1. L1: (4 parts of CPU- quad core CPU) Present inside : 2Kb to 64Kb.
			2. L2: it is available outside CPU , Size: 256Kb to 512Kb
			3. L3: not present in all processor but some high - end processor may have this type of  cache memory. this cache is used to enhance the performance , Size: 1Mb to 8Mb
			(Note: Larger the Size of Cache Memory, Slower will be The Speed)

		WORKING OF CACHE MEMORY:
		-------------------------

		- when CPU needs Data, Fisrt of all it looks into L1 cache. if found then program is started fastly and if dosen't find anything in L1, it looks into L2 cache.
		- if found program is started else if not find anything in L2 cache . it looks into L3 cache
		- if found Program started.this process is called Cache Hit else not found we called it as Cashe Miss.

		Example:
		
		- when computer starts for the first time , or an application is opened for the firswttime  data is not available in cache memory or in RAM.
		- in this case the CPU gets data directly from  Hard Drive(HDD) or SSD.
		- Thereafter when you start your computeror open an application, CPU can get data from cache memory or in RAM

	4.REGISTERS:
	-------------
	- Temp Storage
	- registres referres fast memory locations that are present  aroun the processor for easier access
	- it hold temporary , constantly access data because of how fast they are
	- it increases the performance of processor

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. RAM:
------------

- it is  known as RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY
- it is a hard wear in a computer device where OS ,  Different Applications (MS WOrd, MS POWER POINT, MEDIA PLAYER,BROWSER) which use data to load application
- RAM is a Volatile Memory
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. ROM:
--------


- it is know ans Read only Memory
- it is the memory device or storage medium which stores information permanantly.
- it is NON-VOLATILE Memory 



		WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VOLATILE AND NON-VOLATILE MEMORY?
